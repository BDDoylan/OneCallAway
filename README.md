## Goal:

OCA is a product that allows all users to efficiently communicate to others 
with the ease of a few buttons. In order to achieve such efficient and intuitive 
communication our product will solve the hyper-competitive as well as casual 
personâ€™s craving for communication during their desired activities by giving 
them the tools needed (namely the OCA extension and connected webapp) to generate 
a call with next to no effort or account creation needed. We know our product 
works as intended when we see users in the middle of an activity popping into a 
call to enhance their experience, and see connections being formed without the 
need of making another online presence on a site or asking for your information 
to get started.

## How To Use:

Simply: https://one-call-away.herokuapp.com/

## With Extension:

When downloaded you can simply click the keybind of choice (default: "ctrl + 1") 
and it will take you to your newly generated call when clicking on the notification
pop up.

## Account Creation:

Profiles can be made for OCA which allows for more social aspects to be unlocked and 
logs of calls to be seen. But it is not necessary for the main feature (the calling).
